###Basic Recipe Website
This project is focused on building a basic recipe website to practice my HTML skills. The website consists of a main index page with links to several recipes. While the design might lean towards a more minimalistic or brutalist style, the primary goal is to strengthen my understanding of HTML. In the future, I plan to revisit this project to enhance its visual appeal using CSS.
